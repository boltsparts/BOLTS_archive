    <h2>Attention: BOLTS is beta software</h2>
    BOLTS is in its early stages of development, so expect things to change. But this is also your chance to make things <a href="contribute.html">change for the better</a>.

        <h3> What is BOLTS?</h3>
        <p>The aim of BOLTS is to build a free and open-source standard parts library for CAD applications. It does so by providing a common database that can be utilized by many different CAD applications.</p>

        <p>BOLTS tries to provide a infrastructure and processes that build on three basic principles:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Separation:</strong> The description of parts (dimensions, geometries, ...) is separated into application specific and general information.  This allows to add support for individual CAD applications with minimal effort.</li>
          <li><strong>Automation:</strong> The description of parts is designed to be machine readable. This allows to eliminate a lot of work by automation, and eases the task of maintaining a large number of parts.</li>
          <li><strong>Contribution:</strong> Building a parts library that suits the needs of a wide range of people can only be done by a wide range of people. Therefore BOLTS is designed to make contributing easy.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Features</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Provides GPL and LGPL distributions.
          <li>Built with platform independent technologies like <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> and <a href="http://yaml.org/">YAML</a></li>
          <li>Support for <a href="http://www.openscad.org/">OpenSCAD</a> and <a href="http://freecadweb.org/">FreeCAD</a>, others are planned.</li>
          <li><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/html/index.html">Comprehensive online documentation</a> for all parts</li>
          <li>Easy to contribute to</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Quickstart: Using BOLTS with OpenSCAD</h3>
        <p>Download the tarball with BOLTS for <a href="http://www.openscad.org/">OpenSCAD</a> from the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/downloads.html">Downloads page</a> and extract it into a folder. Start OpenSCAD from this folder or <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/Libraries">Adjust your OpenSCAD library path</a> to make sure OpenSCAD can find BOLTS.  Then add this at the top of your scad file:</p>
          {% highlight python %}
include <bolts.scad>
{% endhighlight %}
        <p> You can now use BOLTS to add standard parts like a <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/html/classes/ISO7089.html">washer</a>:</p>
      {% highlight python %}
ISO7089("M4");
{% endhighlight %}
        <p>For more information see the <a href="{{ site.baseurl}}/doc/openscad/index.html">OpenSCAD Documentation</a>
      </div>
      <div class="col">
        <h3>Quickstart: Using BOLTS with FreeCAD</h3>
        <p>Download the tarball with BOLTS for <a href="http://freecadweb.org/">FreeCAD</a> from the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/downloads.html">Downloads page</a> and extract it into the FreeCAD macro directory. If you don't know where this is, you can look it up in the preferences dialog on the macro tab.</p>
        <p> After starting FreeCAD, type</p>
        {% highlight python %}
import BOLTS
{% endhighlight %}
        <p>into the FreeCAD python console. A widget should appear. There you can select a part from the tree, give values for the parameters and add it to the current document.</p>
