I managed to get comments running for the blog. So you can now comment on what
I write. The comments require no registration, but are moderated, so it might
take a while, until they show up.

The site itself is not as empty as it used to be. The menu on top allows you to
read something about BOLTS, and what I envision it to do at some point. You can
read the blog that at the moment of writing contains two posts (this one
included) and there is a download page with current development snapshots.

The most spectacular part however is the overview over the parts that are
contained in BOLTS right now. You can access the different standards, read the
tables and look at non-existant or very ugly drawings. So actually it is not so
spectacular, but all this is generated from the very same data that also fuels
BOLTS for OpenSCAD and FreeCAD, so it can serve as a always up-to-date
reference on the available parts.
