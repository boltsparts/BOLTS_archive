BOLTS gets a webpage
====================

With the help of [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [Github
Pages](http://pages.github.com/) I created what will in the future serve as the
virtual home of BOLTS.

It took me only a few hours to whip up a decent looking page using the very
nice [Cactus Theme](https://github.com/Wolfr/cactus-jekyll-theme) and spicing
it with an [appropriate
picture](http://www.flickr.com/photos/dkpphotography/9468970843)
by [Dhruv Patel](http://www.flickr.com/photos/dkpphotography/).

The content of this page is mostly non-existant, this will (hopefully change in
the future).
